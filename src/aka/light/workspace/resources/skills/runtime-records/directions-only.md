# Runtime Direction records

Direction recording is enabled; Experiment commands are disabled. Start with root `PROGRESS.md`, then open only relevant `directions/<status>/*.json` and `records/*.json`. These Runtime projections are read-only.

A Direction is a consequential Kernel path or uncertainty, not Runtime/evaluator maintenance. Check for duplicates and rank by expected benefit and applicability. Multiple local Directions may be `in_progress`; the most recently started or prioritized one is the focus. Choose executable work from the Local work queue; restart paused work explicitly. The Shared direction pool is discovery-only: absorb compatible peer ideas into one local derivative and cite every source ID in `derived_from_direction_ids`. Continue bounded probe/edit/measurement/revert-or-keep cycles while useful work remains.

Use `update-direction` and `prioritize-direction` for mutations. Routine execution of plan steps does not require a Runtime mutation; use `action=revise` only when the claim or remaining plan changes materially. Omit `supporting_experiment_ids`; Experiment-derived genealogy is unavailable. Claim-bearing Direction requests may cite their own measurement evidence with `gateway_record_ids`, allowing the independent Review to inspect the corresponding Records. For `candidate_ready`, separately cite `gateway_record_ids` containing a passing standard full Evaluate of the exact clean HEAD. Follow [the exact Direction and report schemas](references/journal.md) and [saved result/source semantics](references/records.md). Never invent IDs or measured results.

Lifecycle is `proposed --start--> in_progress`. Only `in_progress` may `complete`, `abandon`,
`defer`, or `block`; restart `deferred` or `blocked` work with `start`. `completed` and `abandoned`
are terminal. In this Direction-only mode, closure evidence uses `gateway_record_ids`, including for
`abandon`; do not use `supporting_experiment_ids`.

Revise a proposed or active local Direction with `action=revise`, its `direction_id`, and the complete
revised claim and plan. Restart a deferred or blocked Direction first. Completed and abandoned
Directions are terminal; continue them through a new derived Direction. Runtime keeps the ID,
increments `revision`, reruns Review, and preserves lifecycle status and genealogy. Shared peer
Directions are read-only.
